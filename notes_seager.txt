Strengthening Tropical Pacific Zonal Sea Surface Temperature Gradient Consistent with Rising Greenhouse Gases

- Tropical Pacific Important

- There is an west-east warm-to-cold contrast.

- GCMs predict weakening contrast with GHG conc.

- In observations it has increased.

- Our cleverer model agrees with observations.

- GCMs are wrong because of equatorial cold-tongue bias.

- GCMs need to be made better ASAP.


### Conclusions

- stronger trade winds - more shoaling of thermocline.


###  Methods

- ECMWF reanalysis ERA-40 1958-78, ERA-Interim 1979-2017.
  Ocean ORAS4 1958-2017. Thermocline==20.C isotherm.

- ?Python atmosphere model.

- ?FORTRAN ocean model.
