About
==============================

This project is initially undertaken as an MRes project by 
`Simon Thomas`_, graduate student in the `AI4ER CDT`_ 
at the University of Cambridge. 
Thank you to Dr. Naomi Henderson (Columbia University)
for making this model data and code accessible.
It was a lot of fun to get to think about the 
physics over the Pacific.
