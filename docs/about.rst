About
==============================

This project is initially undertaken as an MRes project by 
`Simon Thomas`_, graduate student in the `AI4ER CDT`_ 
at the University of Cambridge. 
Thank you to Dr. Naomi Henderson (Columbia University)
for making this model data and code accessible.
It was a lot of fun to get to think about the 
physics in the long term state of the equatorial Pacific, 
and all the interesting approximations that were made 
back when the field was more computationally limited.
