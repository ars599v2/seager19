Home - seager19 Documentation
==============================
Welcome to the seager19 documentation!

This webpage/document explores the code and data 
used in the seager19 MRes project, and some of the 
motivations for different choices made. The 
first section `seager19` contains the main
`README.md` of the repository, so as to reduce duplication,
and this should provide a reasonable introduction to the 
repository as a whole.

The online version of this documentation is able to include
more interactive features such as gifs of the results.
Therefore, I suggest that the web version is 
probably a better read.
